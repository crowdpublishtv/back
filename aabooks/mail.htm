<i>July 1998</i><br>
While I was doing my research for the Air Force, I rented an apartment on the University of Dayton 
campus.  I found out my paycheck had been stolen from my mailbox while I was at a 
conference at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in July, therefore I called the University of
Dayton police. They came to my apartment and took a report from me.
<P>
RDL, the company in charge of the Air Force summer research program, faxed me
a copy of the check which cleared.  On the back was my forged signature and
the words: "Pay to the order of Ruchika Kheterpal."  It was cashed at a major bank in Indianapolis.
<P>
A few days later I noticed the name on the mailbox of apt. M in
my building -- Ruchika Kheterpal.  I immediately called the police back.
They said that the officer on the case wouldn't be in until the morning.  

<p><i>Friday, July 31 (my birthday) </i><br>
I called the police again, but the officer on the case was out until
Monday.  I told them that everyone in the building would be moving out by
Sunday because the fall students were moving in the following week.  
<P>
I faxed a copy of the check to the police and they called Residence Life to get information
on Ruchika.  Later I called the police back to find out if they received the
fax.  They did, and asked me to call them when I got back to the apartment if
I saw a car from Indiana in the parking lot.  Sure enough, it was there.  
<P>
Ruchika kept walking in & out of the apartment, packing the car and throwing
out garbage.  I called the police twice to say that she was definitely here and
packing her car.  About 1/2 hour later the police still weren't at the
apartment, so I called a 3rd time to tell them that not only was she packing
the car, but the vacuum was running upstairs so I was sure she was about to
leave.  
<P>
Finally the police arrived.  They took her in the squad car and brought her back 45
min. later.  Meanwhile I talked to some neighbors I knew and one of them said
they saw her carry two large boxes into the apartment that afternoon.  
<P>
As I left to go for a walk, There was a large cow-print box in the dumpster
which I saw Ruchika bring to the dumpster about an hour earlier.  My neighbors
were still around and confirmed that it was the box that Ruchika brought into
the apartment that afternoon.  As I got closer to the dumpster, I noticed
Ruchika's name & address on the mailing label.  Sure enough, it was a Gateway
2000 box.  Then Ruchika came out of the apartment building to place something
else in the dumpster so I walked away.  
<P>
After I returned from my walk, Ruchika was talking to a young Indian man in
the parking lot.  As I walked past, they stopped talking and gave me evil
glares.  I called the police when I got inside my apartment to ask if I should
be fearing for my safety.  They told me that they didn't think she stole my
check because her ID was stolen in June so somebody else may have used her ID
to cash my check.  I mentioned that it was strange that she just happened to
purchase a new computer and that according to the stamp on the back of the
check, it was cashed in Indiana.  The officer became a little quiet at that point.
<P>
At around 9:00 there was a knock at my door.  A little
scared, I put on my running shoes, grabbed my cellular phone, and put my
keys in my pocket.  Then I opened the door and closed it behind myself.
Ruchika was alone, about 5 feet tall, and thin.  I didn't feel too
threatened.  
<P>
She said she heard about my check being stolen and that she was sorry it
happened, but she didn't do it.  Her ID had been stolen in June and it is easy
to tamper with Indiana drivers licenses.  I asked how it was stolen.  She said
it had fallen out of her car either at work or at the apartment parking lot.
<P>
In an attempt to either verify or disprove her story, I encouraged a
friendly conversation. We discussed people's junk mail being placed in everyone
else's boxes and her bank account in Indianapolis.  I
mentioned that the thief may have taken money out of her account since the
thief bothered to go to her branch in Indianapolis to cash the check and the
thief had her social security number.  Ruchika said she wasn't too worried about that
since she only kept $400-$500 in her account.
<P>
At one point of the conversation, Ruchika offered to pay me the amount of the
check so she wouldn't have to deal with the police.  I wasn't sure how to
respond to that.  I told her that even if she had done it, giving me the money
back wouldn't prevent her from having to deal with the police.  I still wonder 
what form of payment she intended to use since my paycheck was much higher than the 
amount she claimed to have in her account.


<p><i>Saturday, August 1 </i><br>
Ruchika went back to Indiana to stay with her parents until
Purdue's fall semester began.  When I woke up, I noticed her car was gone and
the cow-print box was still in the dumpster.  I was very curious about how she
paid for the computer.  I didn't really think that I would find that
information, but I decided to examine the box and look inside anyway.  When I
opened the box, I discovered an envelope addressed to myself, (junk mail) 
along with a few opened credit card bills and bank statements addressed to
other people in the building and in West Lafayette, Indiana.
<P>
A few days later, the Postal Inspector drove up from Cincinnati to take
the box and its contents.  

<p><i>September 1998 </i><br>
After returning to Phoenix, I received several calls and letters from the
Montgomery County (Ohio) attorney's office concerning the case and a
possible trip to Dayton in October 1999 to testify against Ruchika
Kheterpal. 
<p>
After considerable trouble and with some assistance from Arizona State University's legal advice 
office, I finally received my paycheck from RDL.

<p><i>June 1999 </i><br>
A representative of Montgomery County called to let me know there would be
no trial in October.  Ruchika failed to appear for a court date in Indiana
where she was being charged with an offence similar to her crime against
myself, except more severe.  Ruchika had left the country.
